<p>This map uses geoprocessing analysis to answer this question:  which neighborhoods in Chicago have no part that is located at least 0.5 miles from a farmers market? I used buffer and dissolve to make a layer showing everywhere within this radius of a farmers market and then selected neighborhoods that do not touch this buffer layer. </p>
