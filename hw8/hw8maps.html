<h1>Homework 8: Georgia Census Data Chloropleths </h1>
<h2>Meg Woodburn</h2>

<p>I mapped the census data of the number of people with a commute of over 90 minutes in each county in Georgia. The ratio that I used to normalize the data is people with a commute of over 90 minutes to total people in the county. This ratio is useful because while a map with non-normalized data would show more commuters in more highly populated counties, this map shows these commuters as a percentage of the population, which makes up for differences in population by county. The map of non-normalized data shows the commuters concentrated around the Atlanta area because of its high population, but maps using this ratio more usefully show how common a commute of over 90 minutes is in each county.</p>
