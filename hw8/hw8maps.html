<p>This map shows the number of people in each county in Georgia who have a commute to work of over 90 minutes. Georgia's main urban center of Atlanta experiences a lot of commuter inflow as well as extreme traffic; it has been ranked as one of the worst places to commute by either transit or car. The concentration of people with an extreme commute of over 90 minutes, the longest commute surveyed in the census, is highest in counties around Atlanta, but these counties also have the highest population. However, commutes of over 90 minutes exist in all of the state's 159 counties.</p>
