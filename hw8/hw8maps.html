<h1>Homework 8: Georgia Census Data Chloropleths </h1>
<h2>Meg Woodburn</h2>

<p>I mapped the census data of the number of people with a commute of over 90 minutes in each county in Georgia. The ratio that I used to normalize the data is people with a commute of over 90 minutes to total people in the county. This ratio is useful because while a map with non-normalized data would show more commuters in more highly populated counties, this map shows these commuters as a percentage of the population, which makes up for differences in population by county. The map of non-normalized data shows the commuters concentrated around the Atlanta area because of its high population, but maps using this ratio more usefully show how common a commute of over 90 minutes is in each county.</p>

<h2>Classification Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>The equal interval classification is useful because it more accurately represents how common commuter of over 90 minutes are in each county; with equal intervals, the majority of counties fall into the two lowest intervals. Quantile and natural breaks classifications make it look like such commutes are more common because they have lower cutoffs for a county to be shown in the middle or upper intervals. The quantile classification makes it seem like commutes of over 90 minutes are extremely common throughout Georgia because it has to show the same number of counties in each bracket; however, the upper intervals are just much larger than they are on other maps. Despite how it may be misleading, the quantile classification is useful for showing variance among the lower-ratio counties because its intervals allow us to see which of them have more commuters, while in the equal interval map lots of counties are all in the lowest interval, so it is impossible to see which of them have more such commuters.</p>
