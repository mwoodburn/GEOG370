<p>The first map shows the production of corn in each county, in bushels per acre. Because bushels per acre involves the acre as a unit of distance, this measure accounts for the countiesâ€™ varying areas to show which ones yield the most corn by area. The second map shows the ratio of cow population to county area.</p>

<p>Nebraska is the state with the highest concentration of cattle by land area, which is significant because livestock production, especially of cows, heavily contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. It also uses up a lot of land because not only do the cows have to live somewhere, additional land must be taken into production to grow feed for the cows, (usually corn). These two maps contrast the locations of cattle and corn production, showing which areas of the state are most used for one or both. The corn in Nebraska is often used for cow feed.</p>
