    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    <p>I changed the projection used to display the Natural Earth vector data in QGIS by changing the project's coordinate reference system. The indicatrix mapper plugin places circles onto the map to show how the map is distorted in each projection.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <p>The WGS 84 projection, or World Geodetic System, is used for GPS. It best preserves shape and size around the equator, as it is a cylindrical projection with the closest contact between the globe and the cylinder of projection being around the equator. This projection greatly stretches out and enlarges forms in the upper latitudes. It preserves distances by keeping the grid of longitude and latitude all the same size, and square.</p>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <p>The Aitoff projection is azimuthal. It best preserves shape along the Prime Meridian, but shape is increasingly distorted with distance from both the equator and the prime meridian. This projection better preserves size than the WGS 84.</p>

    <h2>Equal Area Cylindrical Projection</h2>
    <p>The Equal Area Cylindrical projection distorts shape with distance north or south of the equator like the WGS 84 does, but this projection preserves the size of landmasses by vertically compressing the upper latitudes. This makes the shapes look even more distorted, but it avoids making extreme northern and southern landmasses, like Greenland, look larger than equatorial ones like Africa.</p>>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <p>The North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection is most representative of shape and area at the north pole and distorts increasingly with distance south of the pole. Unlike many other projections it centers around the north pole rather than zero degrees latitude and longitude.</p>>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <p>The Pseudo Mercator projection is like other cylindrical projections in that it distorts increasingly with distance from the equator. However, this projection preserves the shape of landmasses by stretching them vertically in the upper latitudes (the opposite of the process done in the Equal Area Cylindrical projection). The shapes in this projection are accurate but the sizes of landforms are very inaccurate, being extremely enlarged farther away from the equator.</p>

    <h2>Winkel Projection</h2>
    <p>The Winkel projection is azimuthal but modified to have elements of a cylindrical projection. It distorts shape and size, but does not alter either quite as much as a straight up cylindrical or azimuthal projection would. It is most true around zero degrees longitude and latitude. </p>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <p>The World Equidistand Conic projection is similar to the North Pola Azimuthal Equidistant projection, but it has a space between 180 degrees east and west, meaning that it stretches out landmasses slightly less. </p>>

    <h2>Alaska Albers Equal Area Conic Projection</h2>
    <p></p>The Alaska Albers Equal Area Conic projection is conic, and like the World Equidistant conic, it does not fully connect the circle of continents. This projection is different first in that it is centered on Alaska and therefore is very accurate there, and also in that it is an equal area projection. Like the equal area cylindrical projection it compresses the map far from the center of the projection (in this case, with distance south from the north pole), to make landmasses have an area representative of their actual form. This distorts the shape of southern landmasses quite a lot.

    <h2>Sphere Bonne Projection</h2>
    <p>The Sphere Bonne projection best preserves shape closest to the north pole, like azimuthat and conic projections centered there. However, it also preserves shape along the equator, and pretty much preserves area everywhere, not making any one form too large even if shape is distorted.</p>
